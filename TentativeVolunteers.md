# Tentative Volunteers Setup

3 steps:

- create accounts
- get your first Laurels
- monitor/propose additional tasks



## Step 1 - Create the necessary Accounts
You have 3 days to complete this setup. If you need help with any of the steps, ask in this channel.
- create a GitHub account: https://github.com/
- install Metamask as a browser extension: https://metamask.io/download.html and create a wallet. We will only use a test network for The Laurel - currently Rinkeby. Choose one of the created Ethereum addresses (looks like 0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906) to use with The Laurel.
- (while logged into GitHub) edit https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json and add your chosen Ethereum address and you name or nickname (it will appear publicly on our social media bots). This will fork the project on your account. Create a Pull Request to the original project.
- add an avatar here https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/tree/main/data/images. The file title must be your Ethereum address, like 0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906.png
- get Rinkeby testnet ETH: https://faucet.rinkeby.io/
- optionally follow https://twitter.com/provable_laurel, https://www.facebook.com/The-Laurel-Project-688583115349973 and create a https://www.reddit.com/ account if you don't have one yet.

## Step 2 - Get your first Laurels.
- ask another volunteer to be your ancestor in the system and register you (provide your Ethereum address).
- you will get 10 Marketing laurels (equivalent to 10 minutes of volunteer effort) when you are registered. This will help you claim your first task.
- your first task can be: 
    - retweet 5 tweets from @provable_laurel or another volunteer's tweets that are related to The Laurel and the technical projects developed under The Laurel (e.g. @lorecirstea).
    - write a social media post (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit) saying what inspired you to join The Laurel and what your expectations are.
    - you propose your own idea for a task that is compatible with the above
- if your ancestor approves it, he/she will register this task for you in the system and give you the link for claiming. 
- claim the task and you will be awarded with laurels.


## Step 3 - Search, Monitor or Propose Tasks. Then perform them. Repeat. You are part of The Laurel.
In https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/issues for other tasks, from any organizer.
If you do not find a task that you can do, ask in the channel. If you are confident that you have a task for yourself in the interest of the ecosystem, you can add it as an issue yourself. It will get approved or denied by an organizer willing to invest the time.

## Aftermath
After the first week of accumulating the necessary Laurels for your level of involvement, you will have access to the corresponding repos and Discord channels.
